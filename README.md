# DVD Pong
This is just a terrible clone of pong I wrote in C++ with SFML because I was bored in computer class

# Build
Install SFML with your respective package manager and run the following in the cloned repo folder:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

# Running
Copy the res folder to the same directory as the executable, then run the executable: `./dvdpong`
